# Contributing to the Towel project

## How Can You Help?

#### Open An Issue

If you notice anything that can be improved about the Towel project please [create a new issue](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel/issues/new/choose) on the GitHub repository. This could be a bug fix, a possible enhancement, or anything else regarding the project. Creating an issue is just a public post that anyone can see and comment on.

#### Share The Project

Sharing the project with other programmers is a big help. Don't spam of course, but the more eyes on the project the more input can be provided to make the project better.

#### Writing Tutorials, Articles, and Blog Posts

Towel is a very new project that is currently lacking proper documentation. Writing tutorials, articles, and/or blog posts about the project would be a big help. Let the [project developer(s)](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel#developers) know about your content, and it might be linked to from the project README.

Towel has a [wordpress website](http://towelcode.com/) that needs a lot of work. If you would like to help out with the website,  message the [project developer(s)](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel#developers).

#### Show Off How You Use Towel

If you use the Towel in a project and are willing to show it off, message the [project developer(s)](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel#developers) and your project or branding might be linked to from the project README. Showing an active user base would be a big help.

#### Chat on Discord

You can chat with the developer(s) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4XbQbwF). They can give you more specific information on what would currently benefit the project.

#### Work On Open Issues

If you are confident and think you can help out with any open issues, please reach out to the [project developer(s)](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel#developers). Contributing to the code will usually involve the standard GitHub processes of forking the code, implementing the change, and submitting a pull request. Any issues marked as [Good First Issue](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel/contribute)s will generally be the best starting points for helping out.
