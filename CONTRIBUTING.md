# Contributing to the Towel project

Hello and welcome. :) Any contributions to the Towel project are greatly appreciated.

## How Can You Help?

- Open An Issue
	- If you notice anything that can be improved about the Towel project please [create a new issue](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel/issues/new/choose) on the GitHub repository. This could be a bug fix, a possible enhancement, or anything else regarding the project.
- Share The Project
	- Sharing the project with other programmers is a big help. Don't spam of course, but the more eyes on the project the more input can be provided to make the project better.
- Writing tutorials, articles, and blog posts
	- Towel is a very new project that is currently lacking proper documentation. Writing tutorials, articles, or blog posts about the project would be a big help. Let the project maintainers know about your content, and it might be linked to from the project README while relavent.
	- Towel has a [wordpress website](http://towelcode.com/) that needs a lot of work. If you would like to help out with the website,  message the project maintainers.
- Chat on Discord
	- You can chat with the developer(s) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4XbQbwF) for more specific information about what you can do to help out.
- Write Code
	- If there are any open issues in the project requiring development that you think you can handle by all means feel free to fork the code, implement the issue, and submit a pull request. You might want to check Discord first though to make sure no one else is working on the issue.
- Show Off How You Use Towel
	- If you use the Towel in a project and are willing to show it off, message the project maintainers and your project or branding might be linked to or shown on the Towel project.
