# Contributing to Towel

Hello and welcome. :) Any contributions to the Towel project are greatly appreciated.

## How Can You Help?

- Open An Issue
	- If you notice anything that can be improved about the Towel project please create a new issue on the GitHub repository. This could be a bug fix, a possible enhancement, or anything else regarding the project.
- Share The Project
	- Sharing the project on social media, writing articles on social websites, or any other forms of sharing are a big help. The more people using the project, the more refined and user-friendly the code can become.
- Chat on Discord
	- You can chat with the developer(s) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4XbQbwF) for more specific information about what you can do to help out.
- Write Code
	- If there are any open issues in the project requiring development that you think you can handle by all means feel free to fork the code, implement the issue, and submit a pull request. You might want to check Discord first though to make sure no one else is working on the issue.
- Show Off How You Use Towel
	- If you use Towel in a project and want to show it off, we can add a link to your project or just your logo/branding somewhere on the README.
